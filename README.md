Neoclone Is a windows alternative to neofetch since you cant get it on windows

How it works :
using batch windows files it  reads them through a command prompt with the batch file having a simple "menu" ( its just a little acsii and displays system info )
so if you just type "neoclone" into cmd it should show up with a neofetch reminisent sort of screen
